First, we collected data from 100 farms across the Midwest over a ten-year period (2008-2018), including data about temperature, precipitation, and crop yield. Data was gathered from publicly available sources as well as from direct communication with farmers. Secondly, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 farmers to gain qualitative insights into their experiences and perceptions of climate change. Interview data was transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Lastly, we conducted a regression analysis to examine the relationship between climate variables and crop yield. All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS, with a significance level set at p < .05. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University Research Ethics Committee."
