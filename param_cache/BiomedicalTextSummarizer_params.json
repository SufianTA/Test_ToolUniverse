  "text": "In this study, we investigated the effects of the novel anticoagulant drug X-123 on thrombus formation in a mouse model. Mice were randomly assigned to receive either X-123 or a placebo. Thrombus formation was induced by ferric chloride injury to the carotid artery. The size of the thrombus was measured using intravital microscopy. We found that mice treated with X-123 had significantly smaller thrombi compared to the placebo group. Our data also showed that X-123 did not increase bleeding tendency, a common side effect of anticoagulant drugs. Therefore, our results suggest that X-123 could potentially be a safer alternative to current anticoagulant drugs.",
