  "literature_review": "Emerging studies have indicated that the rise in global temperature has significant effects on marine biodiversity. According to Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno (2010), ocean temperatures have increased by 0.1\u00b0C per decade over the past 40 years, leading to coral bleaching and the loss of breeding grounds for various marine species. Similarly, Doney et al. (2012) found that elevated CO2 levels result in ocean acidification, which threatens marine life, particularly shell-forming organisms. In contrast, Poloczanska et al. (2013) suggested that some species may benefit from warmer temperatures, expanding their range and increasing their populations. However, they also warned that these shifts could disrupt established ecosystems. Overall, the literature suggests that climate change poses a significant threat to marine biodiversity, though the effects may vary across different species."
