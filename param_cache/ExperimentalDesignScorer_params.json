  "hypothesis": "Increased physical activity leads to improved cognitive function in older adults.",
  "design_description": "The study will be a randomized controlled trial involving two groups of older adults aged 60 and above. The intervention group will engage in a structured physical activity program consisting of aerobic, strength, balance, and flexibility exercises for 6 months, while the control group will continue with their usual activities. The primary outcome measure will be cognitive function, assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and after 6 months. Secondary outcome measures will include physical fitness, quality of life, and mental health status. The data will be analyzed using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA to determine the effect of the intervention on cognitive function over time."
